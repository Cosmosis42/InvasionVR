This is my final project for my degree, and was developed over a one and a half month period during my final semester. It's an Android game that uses the Google VR SDK for Unity. 

You can download the .apk to your Android device to test it out

How to play:
 Shoot as many aliens as possible and stay alive for as long as you can!
 
 - To shoot missiles, just tap the screen (I recommend using a wireless controller to do this)
 - You can change the controls by tapping the 'CTRL' button on the floor menu. Tap means you tap to shoot, mag lets you use older versions of the Google Cardboard viewers 'magnet switch', and Time will shoot at regular timed intervals.
 - If your screen becomes off-centre, your phone may need recalibrating. However, there is a floor menu button that will recentre your screen for you.

The longer you last, the larger the waves will be, and the faster the alien ships will move/shoot. Remember, you can only get hit 3 times! Make sure to blast enemy missiles to prevent them from destroying your ship.
